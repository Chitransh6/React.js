1. use import export to use component in onother file
  -- default import-export
      -only can export one component
      syntax - export default componentName
             - import componentName from "path"

  -- named import-export
    --can export miltiple component
      syntax -export componentFunction
             -import {componentName} from "path"

2. JXS(javascript XML) is html like syntax language.it used in component.it used   to manipulate DOM using js.it is note html inside javascript.

3. i inserted react in my project using vite bundler.

4. React-DOM is utility of react.we insert this when we work on web.

5. always keep first letter of component name in capital latter.

6. we can use component by writing <componentName/>

7. we can use this multiple time

1. react.creatElement('type',{atributs},'children');
  -- by using this we create the eleemnt in react

2. at the end React render elements as javascript object

3. in render function jsx code are converted into javascript object

4. createElement are given by the bebal
   -babel transpiled our react code into js engine or browser understable language

5. parcel is the is the bundler is is very useful for our project;
    - it handles error for project
    - use for dignostic
    - hot page reloading
    - it builds local host sevver for project
    - it is very fast for its work
    - it use cache to build server in faster then previous time
    - use for image optimization
    - compress the size of file
    - transpiled the code for browser

1. Hooks these are the inbuild functions that we use in react
   
   -- useState => it used to update variables on UI, in general when we udate the verible it does not shows in UI; it makes vary easy veriable updation

     Syntax -  let[state,setState] = useState(initial value)
              
              - useState returns a array that has two things
                 first- current value of veriable
                 second- function, that moniter the update

2. in this class i made a simple counter project that increase the value of counter by one if i click on add value button and decrease the value of counter by one if i clicks on subValue button and  we show the updation of counter on UI by using useState;

1. virtual DOM -> light weight copy of the actual DOM, are created by the 
                 ReactDOM.createRoot function. 
                 ..we see on UI is the actual DOM
                 ..we can not see the virtual DOM it only use for updates  in actual DOM by Reconciliation process.

2. actual DOM -> real dom that we see on UI. all the changes that are appear in actual dom are shown on UI;

3. reconcilation process -> it is the process of appearing all the changes on UI by same stpes like ,making of virtual DOM,diffrentiate the changes in virtual DOM and actual DOM, updating these changes in actual DOM , after these process all the changes are show in UI.

4. differ algorithem -> algo used to diffrentiate actual DOM and virtual DOM

5. React Fiber -> it is the low level architecture that mannage the change in UI. 
       React Fiber Provide some features-
         1.pause the work come to it later
         2.assign priority to diffrent type of work
         3.reuse previously completed work
         4.abort work if it not longer needed

1. we  installed tailwind by vite in react

2. props -> it is the arguments in functions, when we want diffrent data in same components we will pass arguments in component call, as a compone twe can pass object,array,string,veriables, by using props we can make our component dynamic;

   example : 
            there are a component call Card;

             how to pass argument ->  <Card myname = "chitransh"/>
            
             how to use props in card ->  {Props.myname};
               
            -so myname will print in each card according to te argument


3. default arguments are used by the react when we did not pass the arguments in component call, we cans set the default argument on component defination side

        
__video 9__

1.  made a simple background color changer project using usestate,tailwind
  
__video 10__

1. made a Password generator project using hooks like useState, useRef, useCallback, use Effect

2. useRef -> it use to take the ref of any element;
              it returns the veriable;
             
             syntax : const ref = useRef(initial reference);

3.  useEffect -> it used when we want somthing to done after page are loaded; if we want to call some function after any things happens in dependency; 
              
             syntax : useEffect(function,[dependency]);

               example : useEffect( ()=>{
                solve();
               },[pasword,length,some element]);

 4. useCallback -> it use to store the cache value of the dependencies 
                  to make produnction optimal

              syntax : const temp = useCallback(()=>{
                  function();
              },[password,length,some elements]);
